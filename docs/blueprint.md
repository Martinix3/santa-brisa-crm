## Style Guidelines:

- Main Background: An off-white or very light cream (e.g., #F7F4F1).
- Primary Accent Color: The brand's characteristic terracotta orange (e.g., #D97706 or similar). Use for main buttons, charts, and active elements.
- Secondary Accent Color: The brand's turquoise (e.g., #14B8A6 or similar). Use for secondary elements, icons, or subtle backgrounds.
- Tertiary Accent Color: The brand's sunny yellow (e.g., #FBBF24 or similar) to highlight KPIs or positive alerts.
- Main Text: A very dark gray or near-black for maximum readability (e.g., #1F2937).
- Use a clean, modern, and highly legible sans-serif font, such as 'Inter' or 'PT Sans' (loaded from Google Fonts), for the entire application, ensuring excellent readability in a data-driven environment.
- Use clean and professional icons (preferably Unicode or a minimalist icon set) to represent different metrics and actions.
- Use "cards" with rounded corners and very subtle shadows to group information.
- The style should be premium yet accessible, with a retro-modern aesthetic inspired by 1960s Acapulco, as seen in the brand's documentation.
- Incorporate subtle and smooth animations on data updates and form submissions to provide visual feedback to the user.
